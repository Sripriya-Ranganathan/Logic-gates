**Study of basic digital ICs and verification of truth tables for different logic gates**
AIM: To study about the different digital IC’s and to verify the truth table in Quartus for the basic logic gates using Verilog programming.

Equipments Required: Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher Software – Quartus prime Theory Introduction Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. Logic gates are electronic circuits having one or more than one input and only one output. The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic. Based on this, logic gates are named as
